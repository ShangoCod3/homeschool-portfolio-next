            <h4><strong>Physical Education</strong></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I work out regularly. I do a lot of pushups, planks, leg raises, calf raises, etc. I also go to the park a lot and play ball with my little brother or some of my friends.</li>
                <li>I play for an AAU basketball team. We have practice 3 days of the week, and on weekends I have games. I also play in a league called <a href="https://www.leaguelineup.com/welcome.asp?url=i-270youthbasketball" target="_blank">I-270 Basketball</a>. In that league, I only have 2 practices a week and games on the weekend. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/xCZnCaocM7jwShBJ8" target="_blank">Check me out</a></li>
                <li>Sometimes I also do training at the <a href="https://youreachiteach.com/" target="_blank">YouReachiTeach Basketball Academy</a>.</li>

            <h4><strong>Art</strong></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In art, I don't do much drawing anymore, but I do a lot of video editing. Most of them are basketball edits, but I have also done some "day in the life" edits and things of that nature. This is actually something I want to do professionally, so I spend a lot of time practicing. Very soon, I plan to get more advanced software like <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" target="_blank"><strong>Premiere Pro</strong></a>.</li>
                <li>You may click on this <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/F3xKP4MK498neKxXA" target="_blank">LINK</a> to see some of the edits I have done. I hope you like it.</li>

            <h4><strong>Music</strong></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>I own a violin, a piano, and a guitar, none of which I play much anymore. I think it's because I got bored with the kinds of songs I had to learn to play. I am much more interested in Rap and Hip-Hop. A lot of the music I listen to my dad doesn't like, but he has tried to introduce me to a lot of really good hip-hop music. He has created a playlist on <a href="https://www.spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify</a> for me to listen to and has helped me to see rap/hip-hop as an art form. One of the resources we use to study rap/hip-hop is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWveXdj6oZU&t=20s" target="_blank">Vox</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raywI_VvmT4" target="_blank">Diggin the Greats</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/fpV7Gj7SW2E" target="_blank">KingXGreen</a>.</li>
                <li>This also connects to our study of literature. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ICYMAcwx_48" target="_blank">Rap can be literature</a>.</li>
                <li>Another very useful resource that we use is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/levels/z4kw2hv" target="_blank">Bitsize</a> from BBC. <em>I forgot to mention Bitesize earlier, but we use it for almost all our study areas.</em></li>
