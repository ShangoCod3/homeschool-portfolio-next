<h4><strong>Physical Education</strong></h4>

<p>
<ul>
<li>I work out regularly. I do a lot of pushups, planks, leg raises, calf raises,etc. I also go to the park a lot and play ball with my little brother or some of my friends.
 </li>

</li>


<li>I play for an AAU basketball team. We have practice 3 days of the week and on the weeekends I have games. I also play in a league called <a href="https://www.leaguelineup.com/welcome.asp?url=i-270youthbasketball"target= "_blank">I-270  Basketball.</a>In that leauge I only have 2 practices a week, and games on the weekend. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/xCZnCaocM7jwShBJ8" target="_blank">Check me out</a> </li>

<h4><strong>Art</strong></h4>

<li>
In art I don't do much drawing anymore but I do a lot of video editing.Most of them are basketball edits but I also have done some day in the life edits and things of that nature.This is actually something I want to do professionaly so I spend a lot of time practicing.Very soon I plan to get more advanced software <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" target="_blank"><strong>Primiere Pro</strong></a>

</li>

<li>You may click on this <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/F3xKP4MK498neKxXA"target="_blank">LINK</a> to see some of the edits I have done. I hope you like it.

<h4><strong>Music</strong></h4>

<ul>
<li>
I own a violin, a piano and a guitar...none of which I play much ofanymore.I think because I got bored with the kind of songs I had to learn to play.I am much more interested in Rap and Hip-Hop. A lot of the music I listen to my dad doesn't like but he has tried to introduce me to a lot of really good hip-hop music. He has created a playlist on <a href= ""target="_blank">Spotify</a> for me to listen and has helped me to see rap/hip-hop as an artform. One of the resources we use to study rap/hip hop is
<a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWveXdj6oZU&t=20s"target="_blank">Vox</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raywI_VvmT4"target="_blank">Diggin the Greats</a> and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/shorts/fpV7Gj7SW2E"target="_blank">KingXGreen</a>

</li>

<li>This also connects to our study of literature. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ICYMAcwx_48"target="_blank">Rap can be literature</a> 
</li>

<li>
Another very useful resource that we use is <a href= "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/levels/z4kw2hv" target="_blank">Bitsize</a>from BBC. <em>I forgot to mention Bitesize earlier but we use it for almost all our study areas.</em>
